#  NLPlayground

*A collection of my NLP (Natural Language Processing) assignments, experiments, and projects.*

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my coursework and experiments in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
Each assignment explores different aspects of NLP, from **basic text preprocessing** to **information extraction** and **language modeling**.

The repo is structured so that each assignment has:

* 📂 Its own folder (with code, dataset(s), and outputs).
* 📄 A README or description of the task.
* 💻 Implementations in **Python** (using Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb` or scripts `.py`).
